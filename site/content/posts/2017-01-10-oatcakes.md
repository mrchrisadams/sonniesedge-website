Staffordshire oatcakes are only to be found in my home region of The Potteries. They are the fucking _business_. You stuff them with cheese and mushrooms and then stuff them in your mouth.

## Ingredients

With bad German translations because these are oatcakes born and given form in Germany.

* 225g fine cut oats / hafer flocken (extra zart)
* 100g wholewheat flour / weizen vollkorn mehl
* 125g bread flour / weizenmehl type 550
* 1tsp salt / salz
* 2 packets instant yeast / backhefe (about 14g total)
* 500ml warm milk / milch
* 500ml warm water / wasser
* 1tbsp sugar / zuker

## Method

* Mix the oat, bread flour, wholewheat flour and salt in a bowl.
* Mix warm milk and warm water (hot water and room temp milk works just as well)
* Add yeast and sugar to a side bowl and use some of the liquid to make a yeasty soup. Wait for the soup to froth.
* Add the yeasty soup to the dry mixture and then add the rest of the liquid, forming a lovely batter.
* Cover the bowl and leave the batter in a warm place (an oven that has been briefly heated is perfect) for one hour.
* Once the batter is frothy, heat a heavy pan to a high temperature and grease it slightly with butter or oil (not too much - you don't want to fry the oatcakes)
* Use a ladle to scoop out 3/4 of a ladle of batter and pour it into the pan. Swirl the batter around the pan so the mixture coats the bottom.
* There should be holes in the batter - this is a good thing.
* Once the oatcake becomes solid and you can slip a griddle thing under it, flip it over and let the other side cook.
* Slide it out onto a dish and do the same again. You should get about a dozen oatcakes out of the mixture.
