title: Making this site open
---

I remember what it was like when I was starting out with this web game. I didn't have a clue how to build things, how to write code, how to optimise. Like all of us, I was clueless. What got me rapidly going was being able to look at the code of other sites via dev tools, and see how they did things.

But that's only part of the story. All you're seeing there is generated code, not the code responsible for generating the site in the first place? How are new entrants to the field meant to learn if most things are hidden to them?

It's in that spirit that I'm making the source code for this site available publically, after it living for a year as a private Github repo.

It's not going to blow anybody's mind, but it will hopefully benefit others on their jouney to see at least one more website being completely open.
