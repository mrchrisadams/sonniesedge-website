I've been talking at meetups and small informal events since I returned to the web industry in 2012. It's fun, and a way of becoming confidently knowledgeable in a subject area that I had never experienced before.

It was fun, and quite honestly I never thought that it would go much further. I was therefore delighted when I was asked to give my first conference talk at Frontend United Athens, in 2017. 

Since then I've had the privilege of speaking in Hungary, Croatia, the United Kingdom, and France. 

I'm always happy to speak in new locations and at new events. If one of the talks below is interesting to you and your event then please [get in touch](/contact).
